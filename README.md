# Overbond coding challenge

#### Dependencies

* Ruby

#### How to run

To run the program, simply type `ruby run.rb` in console and press enter, you will be prompt on which file and function you'd like to run.

#### Testing

To check the testing type `ruby tests.rb` in console and press enter.

#### Adding your own CSV

To add your own CSV files, just add them to the main directory and the program will find them (make sure they are same format).

#### Misc.

I probably should have used minitest or Rspec, but I wanted to remove the requirement of any dependencies since I was not using one for linear interpolation.
